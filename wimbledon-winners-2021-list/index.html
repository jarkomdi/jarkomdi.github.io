            <article><p> Wimbledon Winners 2021 List: A Look at the Champions of the Grand Slam Tournament</p><p>When it comes to tennis, Wimbledon is the pinnacle of the sport. The prestigious Grand Slam tournament has been held since 1877 and attracts the world's best players to compete for the coveted title. As the 2021 edition of Wimbledon comes to a close, let's take a look at the list of winners and relive the moments of triumph for these incredible athletes.</p><p>Who were the winners of Wimbledon 2021? The men's singles champion was Novak Djokovic, who claimed his sixth Wimbledon title after defeating Matteo Berrettini in the final. On the women's side, Ashleigh Barty emerged as the champion, capturing her first Wimbledon title by defeating Karolina Pliskova in the final. In the men's doubles, Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic took home the title, while the women's doubles champions were Hsieh Su-wei and Elise Mertens. And in the mixed doubles, Desirae Krawczyk and Joe Salisbury were crowned as the champions.</p><h2>Wimbledon Winners 2021 List: A Closer Look</h2><p>Novak Djokovic's victory at Wimbledon 2021 solidified his status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

From Bjorn Borg's five consecutive titles in the 1970s to Serena Williams' dominance in the early 2000s, Wimbledon has been the stage for some of tennis' most iconic moments.</p><p>One of the myths surrounding Wimbledon is the "Curse of the Champion."
